# Compare development to production

The first thing to do is create an `.env` file, as so:

```sh
echo "
LEA_USERNAME=max
LEA_WAREHOUSE=duckdb
LEA_DUCKDB_PATH=jaffle_shop.db
" > .env
```

This example is about comparing data in development to what's in production. For the purpose of this example, there's a `views/prod` directory and a `views/dev` directory.

Let's start by running the views in production. First, the schemas needs to be created:

```sh
lea prepare views/prod --production
```

```
Created schema staging
Created schema core
```

The views can now be run in production:

```sh
lea run views/prod --production
```

Now let's say we're working in development. We would start by creating the schemas:

```sh
lea prepare views/dev
```

```
Created schema staging
Created schema core
Created schema analytics
```

We do some changes by editing the `views/dev` directory. Then we can run the views in development:

```sh
lea run views/dev
```

Now we can compare the data in development to the data in production:

```sh
lea diff
```

```diff
- core.customers
- 100 rows
- customer_id
- first_name
- customer_lifetime_value
- first_order
- most_recent_order
- last_name
- number_of_orders

  core.orders
- 29 rows

+ analytics.kpis
+ 1 rows
+ value
+ metric
```

The diff shows several things:

- The `customers` view got dropped.
- The `orders` didn't get dropped, but it lost some rows. This is because we added a `WHERE` to the underlying SQL.
- The `kpis` view got added, and it contains a single row.

The nice thing is that `lea diff` prints out a neat summary. This output can be highlighted on GitHub, which what we've done above, by using a `diff` code block.

In a pull request, an automated message can be posted with the diff. Here is an example of a GitHub action that does this:

````yaml
